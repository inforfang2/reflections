When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    I think sometimes we don't want to publish changes to public. 
 
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because sometimes we don't want to publish our changes to public yet.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    fork is a clone on remote server. clone is copy remote repository to local 
    or copy local repository to local. branch is seperation of change ways from
    a point.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    We will be updated with lastest bug fixed codes and changes.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    It would be much harder. Maybe it is almost impossible.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    It is the great feature of git , i think. because you can work on seperate
    projects at the same time. When I want to work on new feature or I want 
    to fix a bug I prefer start with new branch then merge branch to master.
