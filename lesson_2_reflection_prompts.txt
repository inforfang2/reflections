	a place for the files which we think they are ready to be commited. and 
	repository saves all changes safe in our main repository. 

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

	step by step by adding the mto staged area , so that you can make them 
	logically seperated.

	to identify it's parents in diagram.  

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges

	- Automaticc merging is good to speed up work but manual is better when two

	. but who is qualified enough to do that.
